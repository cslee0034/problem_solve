## Source

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-students-who-improved/description/

## Approach

FIRST_VALUE(...) OVER(...) 구문을 이용해서 가장 오래된 성적과 가장 최근의 성적을 구한다.

이후 가장 오래된 성적보다 가장 최근의 성적이 더 높은 score를 찾아서 반환한다.

## Code

```sql
WITH RankedScore AS (
    SELECT student_id,
        subject,
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id,subject ORDER BY exam_date ASC) AS first_score,
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id,subject ORDER BY exam_date DESC) AS latest_score
    FROM Scores
)

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM RankedScore
WHERE first_score < latest_score
ORDER BY student_id, subject
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    student_id,
    subject,
    first_score,
    latest_score
FROM (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        subject,
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id,subject ORDER BY exam_date ASC) AS first_score,
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id,subject ORDER BY exam_date DESC) AS latest_score
    FROM Scores
) AS inline
WHERE first_score < latest_score
ORDER BY student_id, subject
;
```
