# 1965. Employees With Missing Information (MySQL)

## Source

https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-with-missing-information/description/

## Approach

모든 id를 구하기 위해 UNION ALL 구문을 사용해서 FROM 절을 만든다.

그 이후 LEFT JOIN을 통해 Employees나 Salaries에 없는 id를 찾는다.

## Code

```sql
SELECT ids.employee_id
FROM (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employees

    UNION ALL

    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Salaries
    ) as ids
LEFT JOIN Employees e1
ON e1.employee_id = ids.employee_id
LEFT JOIN Salaries s1
ON s1.employee_id = ids.employee_id
WHERE e1.employee_id IS NULL OR s1.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY ids.employee_id ASC
```
