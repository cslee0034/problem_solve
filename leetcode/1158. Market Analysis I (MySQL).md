# 1158. Market Analysis I (MySQL)

## Source

https://leetcode.com/problems/market-analysis-i/

## Approach

2019년 사이에 발생한 buyer별 order의 개수를 구한 뒤 LEFT JOIN으로 Users 테이블과 조인한다.

orders_in_2019가 NULL이라면 0으로 처리해준다.

## Code

```sql
SELECT u.user_id AS buyer_id,
    u.join_date AS join_date,
    IFNULL(inline.orders_in_2019, 0) AS orders_in_2019
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT buyer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS orders_in_2019
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2029-12-31'
    GROUP BY buyer_id
) AS inline ON u.user_id = inline.buyer_id
```
